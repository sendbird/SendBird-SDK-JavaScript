# Source Code?

Can you publish the source code? This package only publishes the minified and uglified JS.

We have run into a number of instances where having access to the source code would have made our lives a lot easier.

We have had to unminify the minified JS to figure out how certain things work inside the library.

We pay for the service, and the lack of access to the unminified source code can be a headache at times.

I can't open an issue on this repo, and I have tried to get a response from Support, so sorry for the PR, but I hope someone reads this at Sendbird.

Thank you
